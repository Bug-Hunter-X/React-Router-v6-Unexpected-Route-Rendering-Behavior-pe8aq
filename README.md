# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using React Router v6.  The issue involves unexpected route rendering behavior, sometimes failing to correctly display the appropriate component for the requested route.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy implementation, showcasing the unpredictable rendering.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.  The solution involves careful review of route definitions and potentially addressing underlying state management issues that may interfere with routing.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug.js` file.
3. Run the application and observe inconsistent route rendering.  Navigation may fail to update the displayed component.

## Solution

Refer to the corrected implementation in `bugSolution.js` for a possible resolution.  The solution likely requires a thorough review of your route configuration and data flow to resolve the inconsistent rendering.
